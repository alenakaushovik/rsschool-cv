## **About Myself**

I graduated from Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Czech Republic with a degree in philology.

Unfortunately I don't have any experience in IT, but for more than a year I've been learning JavaScript programming language on my own. At the moment I am taking courses at [RS-school](https://rs.school/) and studying React on [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
I am interested in programming as it helps me to develop and not to stand still, to strive for something and to achieve my goals. In the modern world the profession of a front-end developer is considered prestigious and highly paid, which also attracts me.

From my positive character traits I can emphasise the ability to work in a team, to solve tasks and to learn quickly.
I believe that my diligence, desire and ability to learn as soon as possible will lead me to master the profession so desirable for me.

## **Skills:**

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript (basic)
- React JS, Redux (basic)
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code

## **Code Example**

```
function getMirrorString(number, symbol) {
  let result = symbol.toUpperCase();
  for (let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    result += symbol.toLowerCase();
  }
  return result;
}

function accum(s) {
  let str = s.split('');
  let resultedString = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (resultedString !== '') {
      resultedString += '-';
    }
    let repeatableSymbolChang = getMirrorString(i + 1, str[i]);
    resultedString += repeatableSymbolChang;
  }
  return resultedString;
}
```
