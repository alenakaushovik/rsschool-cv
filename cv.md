## **About Myself**

I graduated from Jan Evangelista PurkynÄ› University in Czech Republic with a degree in philology.  
Unfortunately I don't have any experience in IT, but for more than a year I've been learning JavaScript programming language on my own. At the moment I am taking courses at [RS-school](https://rs.school/) and studying React on [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
I am interested in programming as it helps me to develop and not to stand still, to strive for something and to achieve my goals. In the modern world the profession of a front-end developer is considered prestigious and highly paid, which also attracts me.
From my positive character traits I can emphasise the ability to work in a team, to solve tasks and to learn quickly.
I believe that my diligence, desire and ability to learn as soon as possible will lead me to master the profession so desirable for me.

## **Skills:**

- HTML, CSS
- Git, GitHub
- JavaScript (in progress...)
- React (in progress...)
- VS Code
